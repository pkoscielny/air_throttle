# Air throttle
This project can be used to control throttle valve providing more fresh air from outside.
For example some ventilation system needs a big amount of fresh air while some device is running.
When the device is running the throttle valve is opened and more fresh air can be easily delivered to this device.
When the device is turned off the throttle valve is closed.
The air flow is controlled by throttle valve with stepper motor and microcontroller automatically.
A Hall-effect sensor detects when the device is running.
